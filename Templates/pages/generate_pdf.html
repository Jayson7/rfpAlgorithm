 <p>After carefully reviewing the patient's personal, family, and biometric history, and in line with international clinical guidelines and protocols from reference centres in the United Kingdom, certain measures have been identified that may be beneficial in reducing potential complications during her pregnancy. It is important to note that these recommendations should be evaluated and personalized by the attending specialist, and under no circumstances should the patient initiate treatment without prior consultation with them.

<div class="plan">
    <h6>Plan: </h6>     Consider the use of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) during pregnancy. Generally, a dose of 75-100 mg is recommended starting from the first trimester, preferably before the 16th week of gestation, and continue its use throughout the pregnancy. If the patient weighs more than 90 kg, increasing the dose to 150 mg per day may be considered. 
    â€¢ Follow-up: by your obstetrician and midwife. It is important to note that the final decision to initiate aspirin use, as well as determining the appropriate dosage, should be made by the obstetrician or specialist in charge of the patient. The doctor will evaluate the situation on an individual basis and consider the need for additional complementary tests before making a final decision.

   After completing our questionnaire, our algorithm has not identified sufficient risk factors for specific management of preeclampsia during your pregnancy. However, it is important to note that any condition can arise during pregnancy, even in the absence of pre-existing risk factors. For this reason, it is crucial to follow the recommendations and routine check-ups established by your obstetrician or specialist to ensure a healthy pregnancy and prevent possible complications.

    THROMBOSIS
</h3>

<p>

    <h6>Plan: </h6>  Consider the use of low molecular weight heparin at therapeutic doses from the beginning of pregnancy until at least 6 weeks after delivery. 
    The dose and type of heparin will depend on the patient's weight, as well as other factors that your specialist will assess. 
     Follow-up: It is recommended to be monitored by your obstetrician, midwife, and haematologist. 
     General recommendations: Avoid dehydration by moderating caffeine and tea consumption and maintaining good hydration. It is also recommended to encourage mobility and engage in moderate exercise throughout pregnancy. Additionally, it is important to mention that if you are overweight or obese, working towards a healthy weight can help reduce the risk of thrombosis during pregnancy. 
     Considerations before starting treatment: It is essential to consider other specific considerations for certain cases, such as patients with a history of previous bleeding, bleeding disorders or diseases, anticoagulant treatment, antiphospholipid syndrome, antithrombin deficiency,
    lymphoma, or sickle cell disease, among others. These cases require strict control and management of anticoagulation by the haematologist. It is important to remember that this recommendation should be evaluated and personalized by the specialist physician in charge of the patient, considering their individual clinical situation.

   GESTATIONAL DIABETES

<p>

<h6>Plan:</h6> 
    If the patient is not yet pregnant, she would benefit from a simple glucose test and/or measurement of glycated hemoglobin A1c to assess glycemic function.
 If our patient is pregnant at the time of the questionnaire, the first-trimester blood test usually includes a measurement of fasting glucose. If the fasting glucose values are at the upper limit of normal, an oral glucose tolerance test in the first trimester should be considered to rule out gestational diabetes. 

    Follow-up: It is important to note that the follow-up and management of these test results should be conducted by your obstetrician. In the case of a previous or gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosis, it is recommended to refer to a high-risk obstetrician and an endocrinology specialist for management during pregnancy. 

     General recommendations: Maintaining an appropriate weight both before and during pregnancy is essential. If the patient is overweight or obese, working towards a healthy weight is recommended as it can help reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Additionally, it is important to maintain a balanced diet, rich in nutritious foods and low in added sugars. Regular physical exercise can also help prevent the onset of gestational diabetes.

    After completing our questionnaire, our algorithm has not identified specific risk factors for gestational diabetes. However, it is important to note that diabetes can occur at any time during pregnancy, even in the absence of pre-existing risk factors. For this reason, it is crucial to follow the recommendations and routine check-ups established by your obstetrician or specialist to ensure a healthy pregnancy and prevent possible complications. According to international guidelines, you will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test between weeks 24 and 28 of pregnancy to screen for gestational diabetes.
